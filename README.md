# Metabolic-Tokenomics
A scientific exploration of Metabolic Tokenomics, the framework that models token economies as living metabolic systems. Examines how tokens burn, store, and circulate energy like biological cells, mapping catabolism, anabolism, liquidity flow, yield dynamics, and system health to design resilient, adaptive on-chain ecosystems.
